# üí∞ Flutter Cryptocurrency-wallets App

The design of this App is based on the winning Uplabs-design of *Rudi Hartono*, who has made this [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/cryptocurrency-wallets) design.

The Flutter source is foced on the design of the app. There is no statemanagement or such.

I hope you enjoy and learn from this Flutter based App!
